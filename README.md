### Gallery layout

Recently updated Photos page with waterful layout which is implemented in [hexo scripts](https://github.com/alex2wong/alex2wong.github.io/blob/master/js/src/image-stream.js), inspired by [JamesPan's blog](https://github.com/JamesPan/blog-src)
I enhance the original image-stream, apply **waterful layout**.

Photos page (Gallery) as follow:
